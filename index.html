        <p>I'm a driven Computer Science student in the second year of a Software Engineering degree at the
            University of the West Indies. With a passion for web development, data structures, and
            new computing technologies, I am eager to bring my strong technical skills and creative
            problem-solving abilities to a dynamic team. I am committed to applying my academic
            knowledge to real-world challenges and am enthusiastic about gaining experience in software
            development to launch a successful career in tech.</p>
